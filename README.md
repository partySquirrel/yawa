Yet Another Weather App


Based on https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853

#Open Weather Map API Key is required.

In order for the app to function properly, an API key for openweathermap.org must be included with the build.

Obtain a key from http://openweathermap.org/appid#use,
and include the unique key for the build by adding the following line to [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties`

```
MyOpenWeatherMapApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY">`
```
